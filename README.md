# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daksha Mudumbai

I'm a **Cybersecurity student at Northeastern University** who enjoys building data-driven and machine learning-powered solutions for the next generation of cybersecurity tools.  
Iâ€™m also enthusiastic about data science, risk management, compliance frameworks, threat detection, and leveraging both practical experience and industry standards to shape stronger, more resilient security systems.
